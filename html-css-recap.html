    <h1>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</h1>

    <h3>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</h3>
    <h4>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</h4>
    

    <P>The earliest known appearance of the phrase was in The Boston Journal. In an article titled "Current Notes" in the February 9, 1885, edition, the phrase is mentioned as a good practice sentence for writing students: "A favorite copy set by writing teachers for their pupils is the following, because it contains every letter of the alphabet: 'A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.'"[1] Dozens of other newspapers published the phrase over the next few months, all using the version of the sentence starting with "A" rather than "The".[2] The earliest known use of the phrase starting with "The" is from the 1888 book Illustrative Shorthand by Linda Bronson.[3] The modern form (starting with "The") became more common even though it is two letters longer than the original (starting with "A").</P>
